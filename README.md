# portfolio-website-one
First Attempt at Portfolio Website 

Using concepts of flexbox annd the tools within  CSS to fully deplpy a first functioning Portfolio for prospective employers. Quite a lot of fun to write code from scatch. Definitely adding comments will help make my code seem more clear and readable. A lot of fine tuning could still be done. But nevertheless, quite happy with the product from what I have learnt so far in the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. 

Things to Work On:- 
1) Having a more clear outline in the beginnning rather than spending so much time debugging 
2) Write comments as you go instead of adding them afterwards.
3) Get the basics ((functiionality)) done first and then worry about style. 
4) Keep practicing and try not to procrastinate.
